abstract = {The definitions of the functions div and mod in the computer science literature and in programming languages are either similar to the Algol of Pascal definition (which is shown to be an unfortunate choice) or based on division by truncation (T-definition) or division by flooring as defined by Knuth (F-definition). The differences between various definitions that are in common usage are discussed, and an additional one is proposed, which is based on Euclid's theorem and therefore is called the Euclidean definition (E-definition). Its distinguishing feature is that 0 ≤ D mod d < | d | irrespective of the signs of D and d. It is argued that the E- and F-definitions are superior to all other ones in regularity and useful mathematical properties and hence deserve serious consideration as the standard convention at the applications and language level. It is also shown that these definitions are the most suitable ones for describing number representation systems and the realization of arithmetic operations at the architecture and hardware level.},

Apart from only explaining each technique one by one, we follow a more systematic approach. We identify basic ingredients of these recent techniques and show how they need to be augmented to guarantee correctness in time-dependent networks. With the ingredients adapted, three efficient speed-up techniques can be set up: Core-ALT, SHARC, and Contraction Hierarchies. Experiments on real-world data deriving from road networks and public transportation confirm that these techniques allow the fast computation of time-dependent shortest paths.",

abstract = {In this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). Our structure, Fibonacci heaps (abbreviated F-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by Vuillemin and studied further by Brown. F-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in O(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in O(1) amortized time. Using F-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain the following worst-case bounds, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges in the problem graph: O(n log n + m) for the single-source shortest path problem with nonnegative edge lengths, improved from O(mlog(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the all-pairs shortest path problem, improved from O(nm log(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the assignment problem (weighted bipartite matching), improved from O(nmlog(m/n+2)n);  O(mβ(m, n)) for the minimum spanning tree problem, improved from O(mlog log(m/n+2)n); where β(m, n) = min {i | log(i)n ≤ m/n}. Note that β(m, n) ≤ log*n if m ≥ n.  Of these results, the improved bound for minimum spanning trees is the most striking, although all the results give asymptotic improvements for graphs of appropriate densities.},
